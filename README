   --------------------  P R O J  --------------------

PROJ is a generic coordinate transformation software, that transforms
coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. This
includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations.

For more information on the PROJ.4 project please see the web page at:

    http://proj4.org/

The PROJ.4 mailing list can be found at:

    http://lists.maptools.org/mailman/listinfo/proj

See the NEWS file for changes between versions.

The following command line utilities are included in the PROJ package:

    - proj, for cartographic projection of geodetic coordinates
    - cs2cs, for transformation from one CRS to another CRS.
    - geod, for geodesic (great circle) computations.
    - cct, for generic Coordinate Conversions and Transformations.
    - gie, the Geospatial Integrity Investigation Environment.



UNIX/Linux build and installation:
---------------------------------

FSF's configuration procedure is used to ease installation of the
PROJ system.

The default destination path prefix for installed files is /usr/local.
Results from the installation script will be placed into subdirectories
bin, include, lib, man/man1 and man/man3.  If this default path prefix
is proper, then execute:

    ./configure

If another path prefix is required, then execute:

    ./configure --prefix=/my/path

In either case, the directory of the prefix path must exist and be
writable by the installer.

After executing configure, execute:

    make
    make install

The install target will create, if necessary, all required sub-directories.


Windows build and installation:
-------------------------------

PROJ can be built with Microsoft Visual C/C++ using the makefile.vc
in the PROJ directory.  First edit the PROJ\nmake.opt and modify
the INSTDIR value at the top to point to the directory where
the PROJ tree shall be installed. If you want to install into
C:\PROJ, it can remain unchanged.
Then use the makefile.vc to build the software e.g.:

    C:\> cd proj
    C:\PROJ> nmake /f makefile.vc
    C:\PROJ> nmake /f makefile.vc install-all

Note that you have to have the VC++ environment variables, and path
setup properly.  This may involve running the VCVARS32.BAT script out
of the Visual C++ tree.

The makefile.vc builds proj.exe, proj.dll and proj.lib.


Distribution files and format.
------------------------------

Sources are distributed in one or more files.  The principle elements
of the system are in a compress tar file named `PROJ-x.y.z.tar.gz' where
"x" will indicate major release number, "y" indicates minor release
number and "z" indicates the patch number of the release.

In addition to the PROJ software package, a distribution of datum
conversion grid files is also available. The grid package is
distributed under the name `PROJ-datumgrid-x.y.zip', where "x" is the
major release version and "y" the minor release version numbers. The
grid package can be downloaded from the PROJ.4 website.
