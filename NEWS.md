### Announcements

From PROJ 9.0.0 and onwards CMake will be the only build system bundled
with the PROJ package. As a consequence support for Autotools builds will
stop when the 8.2 branch of PROJ reaches end of life. We encourage
everyone to adjust their build workflows as soon as possible and report
any discrepancies discovered between Autotools and CMake builds.

Details about the build system unification can be found in PROJ RFC 7.

## 8.0.0

With the release of PROJ 8 the proj_api.h API is finally removed. See
<https://proj.org/development/migration.html> for more info on how to migrate
from the old to the proj.h API.

With the removal of proj_api.h it has been possible to simplify error codes
and messages given by the software. The error codes are exposed in the API.

Several improvements has been made to the command line utilities as well as
tweaks in the underlying API.

## 7.0.0

The major feature in PROJ 7 is significantly improved handling of gridded
models. This was implemented in RFC4 (<https://proj.org/community/rfc/rfc-4.html>).
The main features of the RFC4 work is that PROJ now implements a new grid format,
Geodetic TIFF grids, for exchaning gridded transformation models. In addition
to the new grid format, PROJ can now also access grids online using a data
store in the cloud.

The grids that was previously available via the proj-datumgrid packages are now
available in two places:

1. As a single combined data archive including all available resource files
2. From the cloud via <https://cdn.proj.org>

In Addition, provided with PROJ is a utility called projsync that can be used
download grids from the data store in the cloud.

The use of the new grid format and the data from the cloud requires that
PROJ is build against libtiff and libcurl. Both are optional dependencies
to PROJ but it is highly encouraged that the software is build against both.

ATTENTION: PROJ 7 will be last major release version that includes the proj_api.h
header. The functionality in proj_api.h is deprecated and only supported in
maintenance mode. It is inferior to the functionality provided by functions
in the proj.h header and all projects still relying on proj_api.h are encouraged
to migrate to the new API in proj.h. See <https://proj.org/development/migration.html>
for more info on how to migrate from the old to the new API.

## 6.0.0

PROJ 6 has undergone extensive changes to increase its functional scope from a
cartographic projection engine with so-called "early-binding" geodetic datum
transformation capabilities to a more complete library supporting coordinate
transformations and coordinate reference systems.

As a foundation for other enhancements, PROJ now includes a C++ implementation
of the modelisation propopsed by the ISO-19111:2019 standard / OGC Abstract
Specification Topic 2: "Referencing By Coordinates", for geodetic reference
frames (datums), coordinate reference systems and coordinate operations.
Construction and query of those geodetic objects is available through a new C++
API, and also accessible for the most part from bindings in the C API.

Those geodetic objects can be imported and exported from and into the OGC
Well-Known Text format (WKT) in its different variants: ESRI WKT, GDAL WKT 1,
WKT2:2015 (ISO 19162:2015) and WKT2:2018 (ISO 19162:2018). Import and export of
CRS objects from and into PROJ strings is also supported. This functionality
was previously available in the GDAL software library (except WKT2 support
which is a new feature), and is now an integral part of PROJ.

A unified database of geodetic objects, coordinate reference systems and their
metadata, and coordinate operations between those CRS is now available in a
SQLite3 database file, proj.db. This includes definitions imported from the
IOGP EPSG dataset (v9.6.0 release), the IGNF (French national mapping agency)
geodetic registry and the ESRI projection engine database. PROJ is now the
reference software in the "OSGeo C stack" for this CRS and coordinate operation
database, whereas previously this functionality was spread over PROJ, GDAL and
libgeotiff, and used CSV or other adhoc text-based formats.

Late-binding coordinate operation capabilities, that takes  metadata such as
area of use and accuracy into account, has been added. This can avoid in a
number of situations the past requirement of using WGS84 as a pivot system,
which could cause unneeded accuracy loss, or was not doable at all sometimes
when transformation to WGS84 was not available. Those late-binding capabilities
are now used by the proj_create_crs_to_crs() function and the cs2cs utility.

A new command line utility, projinfo, has been added to query information about
a geodetic object of the database, import and export geodetic objects from/into
WKT and PROJ strings, and display coordinate operations available between two
CRSs.

## 5.0.0

This version of PROJ introduces some significant extensions and
improvements to (primarily) the geodetic functionality of the system.

The main driver for introducing the new features is the emergence of
dynamic reference frames, the increasing use of high accuracy GNSS,
and the related growing demand for accurate coordinate
transformations.  While older versions of PROJ included some geodetic
functionality, the new framework lays the foundation for turning PROJ
into a generic geospatial coordinate transformation engine.

The core of the library is still the well established projection code.
The new functionality is primarily exposed in a new programming
interface and a new command line utility, "cct" (for "Coordinate
Conversion and Transformation").  The old programming interface is
still available and can - to some extent - use the new geodetic
transformation features.

The internal architecture has also seen many changes and much
improvement.  So far, these improvements respect the existing
programming interface. But the process has revealed a need to simplify
and reduce the code base, in order to support sustained active
development.

```text
!!!
!!! Therefore we have scheduled regular releases over the coming years
!!! which will gradually remove the old programming interface.
!!!
!!! This will cause breaking changes with the next two major version
!!! releases, which will affect all projects that depend on PROJ
!!! (cf. section "deprecations" below).
!!!
```

The decision to break the existing API has not been easy, but has
ultimately been deemed necessary to ensure the long term survival of
the project. Not only by improving the maintainability immensely, but
also by extending the potential user (and hence developer) community.

The end goal is to deliver a generic coordinate transformation
software package with a clean and concise code base appealing to
both users and developers.

### Versioning and naming

For the first time in more than 25 years the major version number of
the software is changed. The decision to do this is based on the many
new features and new API. While backwards compatibility remains -
except in a few rare corner cases - the addition of a new and improved
programming interface warrants a new major release.

The new major version number unfortunately leaves the project in a bit
of a conundrum regarding the name. For the majority of the life-time
of the product it has been known as PROJ.4, but since we have now
reached version 5 the name is no longer aligned with the version
number.

Hence we have decided to decouple the name from the version number and
from this version and onwards the product will simply be called PROJ.

In recognition of the history of the software we are keeping PROJ.4 as
the *name of the organizing project*. The same project team also
produces the datum-grid package.

In summary:

* The PROJ.4 project provides the product PROJ, which is now at
 version 5.0.0.

* The foundational component of PROJ is the library libproj.

* Other PROJ components include the application proj, which provides
 a command line interface to libproj.

* The PROJ.4 project also distributes the datum-grid package,
 which at the time of writing is at version 1.6.0.

### Updates

* Introduced new API in proj.h.
  * The new API is orthogonal to the existing proj_api.h API and the
    internally used projects.h API.
  * The new API adds the ability to transform spatiotemporal (4D)
    coordinates.
  * Functions in the new API use the "proj_" namespace.
  * Data types in the new API use the "PJ_" namespace, with a few
    historic exceptions such as XY, XYZ, LP and LPZ.

* Introduced the concept of "transformation pipelines" that makes it
  possible to do complex geodetic transformations of spatiotemporal
  coordinates by daisy chaining simple coordinate operations.

* Introduced cct, the Coordinate Conversion and Transformation
  application.

* Introduced gie, the Geospatial Integrity Investigation Environment.
  * Selftest invoked by -C flag in proj has been removed
  * Ported approx. 1300 built-in selftests to gie format
  * Ported approx. 1000 tests from the gigs test framework
  * Added approx. 200 new tests

* Adopted terminology from the OGC/ISO-19100 geospatial standards
  series. Key definitions are:
  * At the most generic level, a *coordinate operation* is a change
    of coordinates, based on a one-to-one relationship, from one
    coordinate reference system to another.
  * A *transformation* is a coordinate operation in which the two
    coordinate reference systems are based on different datums, e.g.
    a change from a global reference frame to a regional frame.
  * A *conversion* is a coordinate operation in which both
    coordinate reference systems are based on the same datum,
    e.g. change of units of coordinates.
  * A *projection* is a coordinate conversion from an ellipsoidal
    coordinate system to a plane. Although projections are simply
    conversions according to the standard, they are treated as
    separate entities in PROJ as they make up the vast majority
    of operations in the library.

* New operations:
  * The pipeline operator (pipeline)
  * Transformations:
    * Helmert transform (helmert)
    * Horner real and complex polynomial evaluation (horner)

* Dial back test sensitivity #255

## 4.9.0

* Implement CMake as an option for building PROJ.4

  shift and init files can be hooked.

* Replace geodesic implementation with one from Charles Karney and add a
  supported public interface (geodesic.h).

* Upgraded to EPSG 8.5.

* Removed old (deprecated) Java bindings in favor of the new api introduced
  in 4.8.0.

* Implement the calcofi (Cal Coop Ocean Fish Invest Lines/Stations) projection

* projects.h no longer installed as a public include file.  Please try to
  only use proj_api.h.

* Add pj_get_spheroid_defn() accessor.

* Added an alternate version of pj_init() that takes a projCtx (execution
  context) structure to address multithreading issues with error management
  and to provide a support for application hookable error reporting and
  logging.

* Upgrade to EPSG 7.9.  Some changes in ideal datum selection.

* JNI bindings reworked, org.proj4.Projections deprecated in favor of
  org.proj4.PJ.

  flag no longer works, and some coordinate systems (ie. Malaysian) will
  need to use +gamma instead.  "epsg" init file updated accordingly.

## 4.7.0

* Added in memory caching of init file search results for substantial
  acceleration in some application environments (like MapServer).

* Regenerated nad/epsg init file with EPSG 7.1 database, including new

  main projection definition lists so they can be used on windows where
  data objects exported from the DLL don't work easily.

* Added JNI (Java Native Interface) support within the jniwrap directory,
  and some supporting entry points directly in the proj dll/so.   See
  --with-jni configure switch, and jniwrap/README.

## 4.4.8

* Updated epsg file to EPSG 6.5, added other.extra pseudo-EPSG WMS definitions

* Made significant fixes to prime meridian support.

* Substantially change pj_datum_transform(), so it and pj_transform() will
  work between coordinate systems with different ellipsoids but no datum
  shift information (assume +towgs84=0,0,0).

* Ensure pj_transform() will try to transform all points in provided list if
  even some might transform properly.
