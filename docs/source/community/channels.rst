Mailing list
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users and developers of the library are using the mailing list to discuss all
things related to PROJ. The mailing list is the primary forum for asking for
help with use of PROJ. The mailing list is also used for announcements, discussions
about the development of the library and from time to time interesting discussions
on geodesy appear as well. You are more than welcome to join in on the discussions!


The PROJ mailing list can be found at http://lists.maptools.org/mailman/listinfo/proj


GitHub
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GitHub is the development platform we use for collaborating on the PROJ code.
We use GitHub to keep track of the changes in the code and to index bug reports
and feature requests. We are happy to take contributions in any form, either
as code, bug reports, documentation or feature requests. See :ref:`contributing`
for more info on how you can help improve PROJ.

The PROJ GitHub page can be found at https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4

.. note::

    The issue tracker on GitHub is only meant to keep track of bugs, feature
    request and other things related to the development of PROJ. Please ask
    your questions about the use of PROJ on the mailing list instead.


Gitter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gitter is the instant messaging alternative to the mailing list. PROJ has a
room under the OSGeo organization. Most of the core developers stop by from
time to time for an informal chat. You are more than welcome to join the
discussion.

The Gitter room can be found at https://gitter.im/OSGeo/proj.4
