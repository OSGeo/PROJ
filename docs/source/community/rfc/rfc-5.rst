PROJ RFC 5: Adopt GeoTIFF-based grids for grids delivered with PROJ
====================================================================

:Author: Even Rouault
:Contact: even.rouault@spatialys.com
:Status: Adopted
:Implementation target: PROJ 7
:Last Updated: 2020-01-28

Motivation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This RFC is a continuation of :ref:`rfc4`. With RFC4, PROJ can, upon request
of the user, download grids from a CDN in a progressive way. There is also API,
such as :cpp:func:`proj_download_file` to be able to download a GeoTIFF grid in
the user writable directory. The content of the CDN at https://cdn.proj.org
is https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data , which has the same content
as https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid converted in GeoTIFF files. In the
current state, we could have a somewhat inconsistency between users relying on
the proj-datumgrid, proj-datumgrid-[world,northamerica,oceania,europe] packages
of mostly NTv2 and GTX files, and what is shipped through the CDN. Maintaining
two repositories is also a maintaince burden in the long term.

It is thus desirable to have a single source of truth, and we propose it to be
based on the GeoTIFF grids.

Summary of work planned by this RFC and related decisions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data/ will be used, starting with
  PROJ 7.0, to create "static" grid packages.

- For now, a single package of, mostly GeoTIFF grids (a few text files for
  PROJ init style files, as well as a few edge cases for deformation models where
  grids have not been converted), will be delivered.
  Its size at the time of writing is 486 MB (compared to 1.5 GB of uncompressed
  NTv2 + GTX content, compressed to ~ 700 MB currently)

- The content of this archive will be flat, i.e. no subdirectories

- Each file will be named according to the following pattern
  ``${agency_name}_${filename}[.ext]``. For example fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif
  This convention should allow packagers, if the need arise, to be able to
  split the monolothic package in smaller ones, based on criterion related to
  the country.

  The agency name is the one you can see from the directory names at
  https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data/.
  ``${agency_name}`` itself is structure like ``${two_letter_country_code_of_agency_nationality}_${some_abbreviation}``
  (with the exception of eur_nkg, for the Nordic Geodetic Commission which
  isn't affiliated to a single country but to some european countries, and
  follows the general scheme)

- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid and related packages will only be
  maintained during the remaining lifetime of PROJ 6.x. After that, the
  repository will no longer receive any update and will be put in archiving
  state (see https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories)

- PROJ database ``grid_alternatives`` table will be updated to point to the new
  TIFF filenames. It will also maintain the old names as used by current
  proj-datumgrid packages to be able to provide backward compatibility when
  a PROJ string refers to a grid by its previous name.

- Upon adoption of this RFC, new grids referenced by PROJ database will only
  point to GeoTIFF grid names.

- Related to the above point, if a PROJ string refers to a grid name, let's
  say foo.gsb. This grid will first be looked for in all the relevant locations
  under this name. If no match is found, then a lookup in the
  ``grid_alternatives`` table will be done to retrieve the potential new name
  (GeoTIFF file), and if there's such match, a new look-up in the file system
  will be done with the name of this GeoTIFF file.

- The ``package_name`` column of grid_alternatives will no longer be filled.
  And ``url`` will be filled with the direct URL to the grid in the CDN, for
  example: https://cdn.proj.org/fr_ign_ntf_r93.tif

- The Python scripts to convert grids (NTv2, GTX) to GeoTIFF currently available at
  https://github.com/rouault/sample_proj_gtiff_grids/ will be moved to a
  grid_tools/ subdirectories of https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data/
  Documentation for those utilities will be added to PROJ documentation.

- Obviously, all the above assumes PROJ builds to have libtiff enabled.
  Non-libtiff builds are not considered as nominal PROJ builds (if a PROJ master
  build is attempted and libtiff is not detected, it fails. The user has to
  explictly ask to disable TIFF support), and users deciding to go through that
  route will have to deal with the consequences (that is that
  grid-based transformations generated by PROJ will likely be non working)

Backward compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change is considered to be *mostly* backward compatible. There might be
impacts for software using :cpp:func:`proj_coordoperation_get_grid_used` and
assuming that the url returned is one of the proj-datumgrid-xxx files at
https://download.osgeo.org. As mentionned in
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2020-January/009274.html , this
assumption was not completely bullet-proof either.
There will be impacts on software checking the value of PROJ pipeline strings
resulting :cpp:func:`proj_create_crs_to_crs`. The new grid names will now
be returned (the most impacted software will likely be PROJ's own test suite)

Although discouraged, people not using the new proj-datumgrid-geotiff-XXX.zip
archives, should still be able to use the old archives made of NTv2/GTX files,
at least as long as the PROJ database does not only point to a GeoTIFF grid.
So this might be a short-term partly working solution, but at time goes, it
will become increasingly non-working. The nominal combination will be
PROJ 7.0 + proj-datumgrid-geotiff-1.0.zip

Testing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJ test suite will have to be adapted for the new TIFF based filenames.

Mechanism to auto-promote existing NTv2/GTX names to TIFF ones will be exercised.
