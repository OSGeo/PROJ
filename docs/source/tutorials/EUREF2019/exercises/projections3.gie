                       The Transverse Mercator projection

In this exercise we will introduce the Transverse Mercator projection, the
UTM projection and the relationship between the two.

In addition we will investigate the differences between the two Transverse
Mercator implementations available in PROJ and when one should be used in
favour of the other.

1. Set up a Transverse Mercator projection using the default parameters.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints:

  * Consult the documentation at
    https://proj.org/operations/projections/tmerc.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

operation   <your answer here>
tolerance   1 mm

accept      24.745          56.437       # Talinn, Estonia
expect      1506742.2481    6535299.3398

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Use the Transverse Mercator to model the UTM projection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The backbone of the UTM projection is a Transverse Mercator projection. In
  this exercise we will model the behavior of the UTM projection using the
  Transverse Mercator.


Hints:

    - Remember that the UTM projection on the Northern Hemisphere uses a scale
      factor of 0.9996, a false easting of 500000 and a false northing of 0.
      UTM on the Southern Hemisphere is similar but with a false northing of
      10000000.

    - The projection center is determined from the UTM zone and can be
      determined by zone*6 - 183

    - Tranverse Mercator parameters are documented at
      https://proj.org/operations/projections/tmerc.html

operation  <your answer here>
tolerance   1 mm

3. Explore the less accurate, but faster, version of the Tranverse Mercator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in the introduction to this set of exercises, two versions of the
Transverse Mercator is implemented in PROJ. The default uses the Engsager/Poder
algorithm which is accurate far away from the central meridian of the
projection. The downside to this accuracy is that the algorithm is slower. The
alternative algorithm, which is toggled by the +approx parameter, is faster but
usage is recommended only within a few degrees away from the central meridian.

In this and the following exercises we will explore the accuracy of the two
algorithms by checking the roundtrip stability of a number of transformations.
A coordinate in Greenland will be used, as it is common practice to store
geospatial data covering the whole country in the same UTM zone. This is only
possible when using the correct algorithm. For the sake of simplicity,
all operations in the following exercises are expressed as UTM projections. The
UTM projection also has the +approx parameter which toggles the use of the
faster, less accurate transverse mercator algorithm.

We will try to determine the approximate roundtrip accuracy of the +approx
algorithm several UTM zones away from the actual zone for the given coordinate.
For all the exercises below the aim is to find the lowest tolerance for each
roundtrip test. You can of course make all tests pass by setting a tolerance of
1000 km - that's not the point: How low can you go?

After you have answered all ex. 3 questions below, based on your findings
consider in which situation use of each of the algorithms is  appropriate.

Hints:

    - gie accepts most common SI unit prefixes to the meter when specifying
      the tolerance, e.g. km, m, dm, cm, mm, um, nm.

    - Look at the output gie produces - the difference between the actual result
      and the expected result is reported when tests fail.
