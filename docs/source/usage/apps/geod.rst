geod
================================================================================

``geod``  (direct)  and  ``invgeod`` (inverse) perform geodesic ("Great
Circle") computations for determining latitude,  longitude  and
back  azimuth  of  a terminus point given a initial point latitude,
longitude, azimuth and distance (direct) or  the  forward
and  back azimuths and distance between an initial and terminus
point latitudes and  longitudes  (inverse).   The  results  are
accurate  to  round  off for :math:`|f| < 1/50`, where f is flattening.


``invgeod`` may not be available on all  platforms;  in  this  case
call geod with the -I option.



Synopsis
********

::

       geod +ellps=<ellipse> [ -afFIlptwW [ args ] ] [ +args ] file[s]

       invgeod +ellps=<ellipse> [ -afFIlptwW [ args  ]  ]  [  +args  ] file[s]

Description
***********
The following command-line options can appear in any order:

::

   -I     Specifies that the inverse geodesic computation is to be
          performed. May be used with execution of geod as an
          alternative to invgeod execution.

   -a     Latitude and longitudes of the initial and terminal
          points, forward and back azimuths and distance are  output.

   -ta    A specifies a character employed as the first character
          to denote a control line to be passed through without
          processing.

   -le    Gives a listing of all the ellipsoids that may be
          selected with the +ellps= option.

   -lu    Gives a listing of all the units that  may  be  selected
          with the +units= option.

   -[f|F] format
          Format is a printf format string to control the output
          form of the geographic coordinate values (f) or distance
          value (F). The default mode is DMS for geographic
          coordinates and "%.3f" for distance.

   -[w|W]n
          N is the number of significant fractional digits to
          employ for seconds output (when the option is not
          specified, -w3 is assumed). When -W is employed the fields
          will be constant width with leading zeroes.

   -p     This option causes the azimuthal values to be output as
          unsigned DMS numbers between 0 and 360 degrees. Also
          note -f.

The  ``+args``  command-line  options  are associated with geodetic
parameters for specifying the ellipsoidal  or  sphere  to  use.
See  ``proj``  `documentation <proj.html>`_ for full list of these parameters and
controls.  The options are processed in  left  to  right  order
from  the  command  line.  Reentry of an option is ignored with
the first occurrence assumed to be the desired value.

One or more files (processed in left to  right  order)  specify
the  source  of  data  to be transformed.  A - will specify the
location of processing standard input.  If no files are  specified,
the input is assumed to be from stdin.

For  direct determinations input data must be in latitude, longitude,
azimuth and distance order and output will be latitude,
longitude  and  back  azimuth of the terminus point.  Latitude,
longitude of the initial and terminus point are input  for  the
inverse  mode  and respective forward and back azimuth from the
initial and terminus points are output along with the  distance
between the points.

Input  geographic  coordinates  (latitude  and  longitude)  and
azimuthal data must be in decimal degrees  or  DMS  format  and
input distance data must be in units consistent with the ellipsoid
major axis or sphere radius units.  The latitude must  lie
in the range [-90d,90d].  Output geographic coordinates will be
in DMS (if the -f switch is not employed) to 0.001" with trailing,
zero-valued minute-second fields deleted.  Output distance
data will be in the same  units  as  the  ellipsoid  or  sphere
radius.

The Earth's ellipsoidal figure may be selected in the same manner
as program ``proj`` by using ``+ellps=``, ``+a=``, ``+es=``, etc.

Geod may also be used to determine  intermediate  points  along
either  a  geodesic  line between two points or along an arc of
specified distance from a geographic point.  In both  cases  an
initial  point must be specified with ``+lat_1=lat`` and ``+lon_1=lon``
parameters  and  either  a  terminus   point   ``+lat_2=lat``   and
``+lon_2=lon``  or  a  distance  and azimuth from the initial point
with ``+S=distance`` and ``+A=azimuth`` must be specified.

If points along a geodesic are to  be  determined  then  either
``+n_S=integer``  specifying  the  number  of  intermediate  points
and/or  ``+del_S=distance``  specifying  the  incremental  distance
between points must be specified.

To  determine  points along an arc equidistant from the initial
point both ``+del_A=angle``  and  ``+n_A=integer``  must  be  specified
which determine the respective angular increments and number of
points to be determined.

Examples
********

The following script determines the geodesic azimuths and  distance in U.S.
statute miles from Boston, MA, to Portland, OR:

::

     geod +ellps=clrk66 <<EOF -I +units=us-mi
     42d15'N 71d07'W 45d31'N 123d41'W
     EOF

which gives the results:

::

     -66d31'50.141" 75d39'13.083" 2587.504

where the first two values are the azimuth from Boston to Portland,
the back azimuth from Portland to Boston followed by the distance.

An  example  of forward geodesic use is to use the Boston loca-
tion and determine Portland's location by azimuth and distance:

::

     geod +ellps=clrk66 <<EOF +units=us-mi
     42d15'N 71d07'W -66d31'50.141" 2587.504
     EOF

which gives:

::

     45d31'0.003"N 123d40'59.985"W 75d39'13.094"

.. note::
    Lack  of precision in the distance value compromises the
    precision of the Portland location.
