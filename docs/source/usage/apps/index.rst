Bundled with PROJ.4 comes a set of small command line utilities. The
``proj`` program is limited to converting between geographic and projection
coordinates within one datum. The ``cs2cs`` program operates similarly, but
allows translation between any pair of definable coordinate systems, including
support for basic datum translation. The ``geod`` program provides the ability
to do geodesic (great circle) computations.
