This operations makes it possible to retrieve coordinate components that was
saved in previous pipeline steps. A retrieved coordinate component is loaded,
or *popped*, from a memory stack that is part of a :ref:`pipeline<pipeline>`.
The pipeline coordinate stack is inspired by the stack data structure that is
commonly used in computer science. There's four stacks available: One four each
coordinate dimension. The dimensions, or coordinate components, are numbered
1--4. It is only possible to move data to and from the stack within the same
coordinate component number. Values can be saved to the stack by using the
:ref:`push operation<push>`.

If the pop operation is used by itself, e.g. not in a pipeline, it will
function as a no-operation that passes the coordinate through unchanged.
Similarly, if no coordinate component is available on the stack to be popped
the operation does nothing.

As of PROJ 9.4.0, this operation is supersed by the :ref:`stack<stack>` operation.
Note that the stacks of ``stack`` and ``push/pop`` are totally separated.

Examples
################################################################################

A common use of the :ref:`push<push>` and pop operations is in 3D
:ref:`Helmert<helmert>` transformations where only the horizontal components
are needed. This is often the case when combining heights from a legacy
vertical reference with a modern geocentric reference. Below is a an example of
such a transformation, where the horizontal part is transformed with a Helmert
operation but the vertical part is kept exactly as the input was.

::

   $ echo 12 56 12.3 2020 | cct +proj=pipeline  \
   +step +proj=push +v_3                        \
   +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80                \
   +step +proj=helmert +x=3000 +y=1000 +z=2000  \
   +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +inv           \
   +step +proj=pop +v_3                         \

    12.0056753463   55.9866540552       12.3000     2000.0000

Note that the third coordinate component in the output is the same as the input.

The same transformation without the push and pop operations would look like this::

   $ echo 12 56 12.3 2020 | cct +proj=pipeline  \
   +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80                \
   +step +proj=helmert +x=3000 +y=1000 +z=2000  \
   +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80 +inv           \

         12.0057        55.9867     3427.7404     2000.0000

Here the vertical component is adjusted significantly.
