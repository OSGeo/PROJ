.. option:: +t_final=<time>

    Final epoch that the coordinate will be propagated to after transformation.
    The special epoch *now* can be used instead of writing a specific period in
    time. When *now* is used, it is replaced internally with the epoch of the
    transformation. This means that the resulting coordinate will be slightly
    different if carried out again at a later date.
