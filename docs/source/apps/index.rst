The  proj  program  is  limited  to   converting
between  geographic  and  projection coordinates
within one datum.

The cs2cs program operates similarly, but allows
translation  between any pair of definable coor-
dinate  systems,  including  support  for  datum
translation.

The geod program provides the ability to compute
geodesic (Great Circle) computations.

The cct program does general 4D transformations.
