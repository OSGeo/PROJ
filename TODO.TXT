- Functional:
    - export as ESRI WKT 1 ?
    - WKTv2 Bison based validator ?
    - import from Proj4
            init= syntax
    - derived crs
    - test sphericalCS
    - identification of CRS code from registry from name, etc
    - proj.db: integrate ESRI catalog, IGNF ?

    - transformation with WEST longitude
    GEOGCS["Mars2015",
        DATUM["D_Mars_2015",
            SPHEROID["Mars_2015_IAU_OCENTRIC",3396190,169.89444722360980],
            TOWGS84[0,0,0]],

        UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295],
        AXIS["latitude",NORTH],
        AXIS["longitude",WEST]]
    - axis inversion for polar cases: EPSG 5041 (East-North) vs EPSG 32661 (North-East)
    - We might currently create COMPOUNDCRS of horiz CRS + BoundCRS of VertCRS, which is apparently illegal

    - Time dependent stuff:
        - PointMotionOperation
        - time-specific Helmert (codes 1065 and 1066)
        - sourceEpochCoordinate and targetEpochCoordinate in CoordinateOperation are unused/unset

    
- Integrate Doxygen doc in PROJ doc
- More tests
- Address TODO and FIXME

- Once integrated with GDAL, test with BAG WKT
