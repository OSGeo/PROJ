- Functional:
    - export as ESRI WKT 1 ?
    - WKTv2 Bison based validator ?
    - import from Proj4
            init= syntax
    - derived crs
    - test sphericalCS
    - identification of CRS code from registry from name, etc
    - proj.db: integrate ESRI catalog, IGNF ?

    - transformation with WEST longitude

    - axis inversion for polar cases: EPSG 5041 (East-North) vs EPSG 32661 (North-East)
    - We might currently create COMPOUNDCRS of horiz CRS + BoundCRS of VertCRS, which is apparently illegal

    - Time dependent stuff:
        - PointMotionOperation
        - time-specific Helmert (codes 1065 and 1066)
        - sourceEpochCoordinate and targetEpochCoordinate in CoordinateOperation are unused/unset

    - deal with alternate grid names
    - implement export to PROJ of     "Geographic3D to GravityRelatedHeight (EGM2008)" ( projinfo -s EPSG:4979 -t EPSG:3855 )
    - implement export to PROJ of  METHOD["NADCON"  ID["EPSG",1241]
    - src/projinfo -k operation EPSG:7811
            input string: error while querying database: cannot build transformation 7811: Inconsistent chaining of CRS in operations
            see  https://www.epsg-registry.org/export.htm?gml=urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::7811
    - use an intermediate CRS when going from A of B
        ogrinfo data/proj.db -sql "select v1.code as code1, v1.name as name1, v1.accuracy as accuracy1, v2.code as code2, v2.name as name2, v2.accuracy as accuracy2 from coordinate_operation_view v1 join coordinate_operation_view v2 on v1.target_crs_code = v2.source_crs_code where v1.source_crs_code = 4275 and v2.target_crs_code = 4179 AND v1.deprecated = 0 AND v2.deprecated = 0 order by (CASE WHEN accuracy1 is NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN accuracy2 is NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), accuracy1 + accuracy2"

- Integrate Doxygen doc in PROJ doc
- More tests
- Address TODO and FIXME

- Once integrated with GDAL, test with BAG WKT
