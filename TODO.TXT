- Functional:
    - export as ESRI WKT 1 ?
    - WKTv2 Bison based validator ?
    - import from Proj4
            init= syntax
    - derived crs
    - test sphericalCS
    - PointMotionOperation

    - transformation with WEST longitude

    - axis inversion for polar cases: EPSG 5041 (East-North) vs EPSG 32661 (North-East)
    - We might currently create COMPOUNDCRS of horiz CRS + BoundCRS of VertCRS, which is apparently illegal

    
- Integrate Doxygen doc in PROJ doc
- More tests
- Address TODO and FIXME

- Once integrated with GDAL, test with BAG WKT
