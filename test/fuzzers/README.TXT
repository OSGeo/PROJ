This directory contain fuzzer main functions and scripts for the
Google OSS Fuzz project: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/

The main build scripts are in:

and call scripts in this directory.

The list of issues is in:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=proj4

- Build standard_fuzzer in a standalone mode:

    $ g++ -g -std=c++11 standard_fuzzer.cpp -o standard_fuzzer -fvisibility=hidden -DSTANDALONE ../../build/lib/libproj.a -lpthread -lsqlite3 -I../../src -I../../include

  Run it:
    $ PROJ_LIB=../../data ./standard_fuzzer {file_generated_by_oss_fuzz}

- Run locally OSS Fuzz:
    $ git clone https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.git
    $ cd oss-fuzz
    $ export PROJECT_NAME=proj4
    $ python infra/helper.py build_image $PROJECT_NAME

  Build fuzzers with the address sanitizer (could use undefined, etc...)
    $ python infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --sanitizer address $PROJECT_NAME

  Test a particular fuzzer (replace standard_fuzzer by other fuzzers)
    $ python infra/helper.py run_fuzzer $PROJECT_NAME standard_fuzzer
