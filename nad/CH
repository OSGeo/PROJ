# This init file provides definitions for CH1903 and CH1903/LV03
# projections using the distortion grids developed by Swisstopo.
# See: http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/topics/survey/lv03-lv95/chenyx06/distortion_grids.html
#
# You'll need to download the grids separately and put in a directory
# scanned by libproj. Directories may be added to the scan list through
# the PROJ_LIB environment variable
#
# Note that an independent effort was made to derive an usable grid
# from the CH1903->CH1903+ grid initially available from the Swisstopo
# website. You can read about this other effort here:
# http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2012-February/006093.html
# It may be of interest because the latter was by some reported as being
# more accurate than the former:
# http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2012-February/006119.html

# This init file uses the official one
