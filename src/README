             Installation README --- @(#)README	4.4 94/10/05 GIE REL"

At the current time, installation only performed to PROJ.4 directory and
information not transfered via normal "install(1)" function because of
the diversity of system variations.

There are occasional errors encountered with "ranlib."  Makefile tests
for presence in either /bin or /usr/bin and will execute.  Even if found,
some systems choke.  Such choking is ignored with no apparent ill results.

As an alternative to editing the head of the Makefile, the following can
be used on the run line:

For Suns without vendor ANSI C compiler, use GNU's gcc and
	make install CC=gcc COMP='-O -DNO_STRERRNO'
Apparently the name max is missing from gcc includes and the Sun
library does not include the ANSI strerrno function.

For DEC Ultrix: (brain damaged strtod implementation)
	make install STRTOD='$L(strtod.o)'
The DEC people just can't seem to forget the dinosaur FORTRAN.
Ignore compiler warnings about "unimplemented const."

For Dell SVR4 issue 2.2 do
	make install

For Data General:
	make install COMP='-O -ansi'
Ranlib in system but execution denied(?)---error ignored.

If repeatative compilations or linkages are expected, it is better
to edit these flags into the beginning of the Makefile after saving
a copy of the original.

Check /usr/include/math.h for prototype of hypot.  If missing it is
probably not in libm.a and it is necessary to use supplied version.

	make install HYPOT='$L(hypot.o)'
		or
	make install HYPOT='$L(hypot.o)' STRTOD='$L(strtod.o)'

To check for brain damaged versions of strtod try the following after
using the local system's version (default):

proj +proj=poly +ellps=clrk66 +no_defs <<EOF
3.5 33.25
3d30 33d15
EOF

Both geographic coordinates should produce the same cartesian result.
If not, then it is almost a certainty that libc.a has a version modified
to accept d | D as an alternative to e | E.  This "extension" to ANSI
specifications causes untold grief.  Use the ANSI compliant GNU version
included.

The default installation library is set at /usr/local/lib even though
actual transfer of files not made.  To set to an alternative library
use LIB=<library path> on the make run-line or edit Makefile.

To truely install:

	BIN=<favorite executable area?
	LIB=<basic library area, same as in Makefile's>
	INC=<include file area>
	cp proj $BIN
	ln ${BIN}/proj ${BIN}/invproj
	cp geod $BIN
	cp proj_def.dat $LIB/proj
	cp libproj.a $LIB
	cp projects.h $INC
	cd ../nad
	cp nad27 $LIB/proj
	cp nad83 $LIB/proj
