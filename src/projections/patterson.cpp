 * The Patterson Cylindrical projection was designed by Tom Patterson, US National
 * Park Service, in 2014, using Flex Projector. The polynomial equations for the
 * projection were developed by Bojan Savric, Oregon State University, in
 * collaboration with Tom Patterson and Bernhard Jenny, Oregon State University.
 *
 * Java reference algorithm implemented by Bojan Savric in Java Map Projection
 * Library (a Java port of PROJ.4) in the file PattersonProjection.java.
