The files in this directory are support data for PROJ.4 programs
as well as test scripts for testing proj installation.

File Contents:

README  --- This file

proj_def.dat --- basic default file used by proj.

epsg    --- Translation of EPSG GCS/PCS codes into PROJ.4 via init= mechanism.

epsg-deprecated --- EPSG definitions that have been deprecated. They are
                not part of 'epsg' anymore, but may have been delivered
		with earlier versions of 'epsg'.
		Thus, they might occur e.g. in WMS (Web Mapping Services)
		running with old EPSG definitions.
		This file is not complete at all - it contains just
		definitions that were individually reported.

nad27   --- North American Datum 1927 for "init=" definition of
			State Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCS).

nad83   --- North American Datum 1983 for "init=" definition of SPCS.

GL27    --- Great Lakes Survey grids, NAD27

world   --- Proj specifications for several international grid systems.

nad.lst --- Reference list of SPCS States and NGS datum identifiers

IGNF    --- Translation of French Mapping Agency codes into PROJ.4 via init= mechanism.

nad2bin.c   --- C program to convert above ASCII files into binary
				files usable by program nad2nad.  Compiled and used in
				install script only.

install     --- Unix shell (sh) script to install nad2nad file and proj
				init files.  Read beginning for usage instructions.

test27      --- Unix shell (sh) scripts to test installation of
test83          proj and nad27/nad83 init files.  These scripts
                expect release 4 proj to reside in ../src.

pj_out27    --- Comparison files for above test procedures.
