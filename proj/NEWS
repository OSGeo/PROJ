4.9.1 Release Notes
-------------------
 
 o 4.9.0RC2 release was abandoned because it was not promoted in a 
   timely fashion. Subsequent maintenance of tickets has continued, 
   and a new 4.9.1 release was issued in its place.

 o Implement inverse solution for Winkel Tripel from Drazan Tutic #250

 o More CMake configuration tweaks. The CMake configuration is probably 
   not at feature parity with the autotools builds at this point but it 
   is converging #256
 
 o Tweak initialization ordering around setlocal which may have caused
   issues #237

 o Support out-of-tree autoconf builds more completely #247

 o Fix NaN handling by geod_inverse and geod_polygon_addedge #251 & #253

 o Update config.sub and config.guess #257
 
 o Adapt Charles Karney's CMake patches for smoother build #258

 o Define default PROJ_LIB location for CMake compilation #261

 o Fix Windows compilation on PJ_aitoff.c

 o Align CMake SOVERSION with autotools #263

 o Regenerate nad/epsg with GDAL r28536 to avoid precision loss in TOWGS84
   parameters, e.g. on Amersfoort / RD EPSG:4289 (#260)

 o Add CMake project-config.cmake scripts (#264 from Charles Karney)

 o Dial back test sensitivity #255

4.9.0 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Implement CMake as an option for building PROJ.4

 o Implement new virtual file api (projFileAPI) so that all access to grid
   shift and init files can be hooked.

 o Replace geodesic implementation with one from Charles Karney and add a 
   supported public interface (geodesic.h).

 o Upgraded to EPSG 8.5.

 o Removed old (deprecated) Java bindings in favor of the new api introduced
   in 4.8.0.

 o Implement the calcofi (Cal Coop Ocean Fish Invest Lines/Stations) projection

 o Install projects.h again for applications that want access to internal
   structures and functions despite the inherent fragility.

 o Various bug fixes and cleanup.

 o Added the CalCOFI pseudo-projection, #135

4.8.0 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Added the Natural Earth projection.

 o Added HEALPIX, rHEALPIX and Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area projections.

 o nad2bin now produces "CTable2" format grid shift files by default which
   are platform independent.  

 o nad2nad removed, use cs2cs for datum shift operations. 

 o projects.h no longer installed as a public include file.  Please try to
   only use proj_api.h. 

 o Add pj_get_spheroid_defn() accessor.

 o Added an alternate version of pj_init() that takes a projCtx (execution
   context) structure to address multithreading issues with error management
   and to provide a support for application hookable error reporting and
   logging.

 o Upgrade to EPSG 7.9.  Some changes in ideal datum selection.

 o JNI bindings reworked, org.proj4.Projections deprecated in favor of 
   org.proj4.PJ. 

 o Added preliminary vertical datum support.

 o Fix various multithreading issues, particular in datum grid handling code.

 o Added support for the +axis= option for alternate axis orientations as
   part of a coordinate system (used for TM South Orientated support).

 o +proj=omerc implementatioin replaced with code from libproj4.  +rot_conv
   flag no longer works, and some coordinate systems (ie. Malaysian) will
   need to use +gamma instead.  "epsg" init file updated accordingly.
   

4.7.0 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Added in memory caching of init file search results for substantial
   acceleration in some application environments (like MapServer). 

 o Regenerated nad/epsg init file with EPSG 7.1 database, including new
   support for Google Mercator (EPSG:3857).

 o Various thread safety improvements, including preliminary support for
   a mutex lock around some operations, like grid loading.


4.6.1 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Upgraded to EPSG 6.17 version for nad/epsg.  Also corrected the precision
   problem introduced in the last version.

 o Added logic for tmerc projection to fail rather than return crazy results
   if more than 90 degrees away from the central meridian (#5).  This change
   may only be temporary till a more comprehensive solution is found.

 o Fixed handling of extra text in cs2cs.  

 o Renamed INSTALL to INSTALL.TXT.
 
 o The eqc projection has been generalized to include a latitude of origin.

 o Added the glabsgm (Gauss Laborde / Sphere Geometric Mean) projection,
   and gstmerc variation.
 
 o nad/IGNF init catalogue created.

 o added the ntf_r93.gsb datum shift file.

 o Add /Op in nmake.opt compile options to avoid VC7 optimization bug (#12)

 o Fix testvarious test script so it works properly when grid files available
 

 
4.6.0 Release Notes
-------------------

 o MAJOR: Rework pj_transform() to avoid applying ellipsoid to ellipsoid
   transformations as a datum shift when no datum info is available.

 o Avoid applying "change of ellipsoid" during datum shifting based on
   ellipsoids getting changed to spheres for spherical projections.

 o Upgrade to EPSG 6.13
 
 o Added "900913" "Google Mercator" code in nad/esri.extra.

 o Avoid some static variable based multi-threading problems. 

 o Improve error recovery if ctable style datum shift grid fails to load.

 o Support drive letters properly in PROJ_LIB paths for win32.
 
 o Fix occasional problem with DMS parsing. 

 o Removed non-functional mpoly projection.

 o add lonlat, and latlon as aliases for longlat. 

   
4.5.0 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Microsoft Visual Studio 8 compatibility changes. 
 
 o Upgraded to EPSG 6.11.1 database. 

 o Several bug fixes to pj_transform() to handle transient errors properly.

 o Fix Krovak projection (include +czech flag)

 o Added Roussilhe Stereographic projection from libproj4 (proj=rouss).

 o Added experimental +lon_wrap flag for alternate pj_transform() longitude
   wrapping behavior on output.


4.4.9 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Win32 build uses proj.dll by default now. 

 o Added accessor functions for the datums, ellps, prime_meridians, units and
   main projection definition lists so they can be used on windows where 
   data objects exported from the DLL don't work easily.

 o Added JNI (Java Native Interface) support within the jniwrap directory, 
   and some supporting entry points directly in the proj dll/so.   See
   --with-jni configure switch, and jniwrap/README. 

 o Added the proj=stereoa and proj=geos projections, incorporated from
   Gerald's libproj4.

 o A few other bug fixes.


4.4.8 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Updated epsg file to EPSG 6.5, added other.extra pseudo-EPSG WMS definitions

 o Made significant fixes to prime meridian support. 
 
 o Substantially change pj_datum_transform(), so it and pj_transform() will
   work between coordinate systems with different ellipsoids but no datum
   shift information (assume +towgs84=0,0,0). 

 o Added pj_get_release() function.

 o Ensure pj_transform() will try to transform all points in provided list if 
   even some might transform properly.  

 o Improved the accuracy of Geocentric_To_Geodetic() via an iterative
   solution.  

 o Various other bug fixes. 


4.4.7 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Added NTv2 (.gsb) grid shift file support.  

 o Modified datum shift support so that data file data is only loaded if
   needed.  Also added 'null' grid as a fallback option, and support for 
   making grids optional (prefix with '@' in +nadgrids). 

 o Regenerated nad/epsg file with towgs84 parameters for non-greenwich prime 
   meridians.

 o Updated nad/esri file with better generated form from Paul Ramsey.

 o Various bug fixes. 


4.4.6 Release Notes
-------------------

 o Incorporated new lcca (Lambert Conformal Conic Alternate) projection from
   Gerald.

 o Updated 'espg' translation file for EPSG 6.2.2 with better support for
   prime meridians. 

 o Added Prime Meridians via +pm command switch to cs2cs (and pj_transform).

 o Fixed bug with 7 parameter transforms. 

 o Added 'esri' pseudo-epsg coordinate system file. 

 o Cleanup so that PROJ.4 compiles clean as C++ code.

 o Added pj_get_def() to expand definitions of stuff like +init clauses.

 o Added a Krovak implementation (proj=krov).  Note this may change again
   in the next release.
