Rel. 4.3.2 94/10/30 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

95/4/27
	Corrected rf factor for GRS67.
	Thanks to: Peter Shih tyshih@cc.nctu.edu.tw

95/6/3
	Gave an initializing value for pj_errno.  Someone's compiler ignored
	the whole module because nothing happened(!!!).
	Thanks to: Mark Crispin <MRC@Panda.COM>.

95/7/6
	Corrected function pj_inv_mlfn for improper derivative code.
	Previous computations not in error but convergence was slower.
	Thanks to: Tony Fisher fisher@minster.york.ac.uk.

95/8/8
	Added Swiss Oblique Mercator projection.  CH1903 Swiss grid system
	parameters added to nad/world.  <CH1903> added to nad/world file
	and N-somerc.ps.Z added to documentation notes.
	Thanks to: Daniel Ebneter, ebneter@iap.unibe.ch.

95/9/5
	Changed declaration of "char c" to "int c" to more properly monitor
	error return value in pj_init.c.
	Thanks to: Alejo Hausner (ah@cs.princeton.edu)

95/9/10
	Some minor file/internal name changes to facilitate xport to primative
	systems.  Documented entries unchanged.

Rel. 4.3.1 94/2/16 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

94/6/2
	Transverse Mercator, spherical inverse fixed.  Misplaced parenthsis.

94/10/5
	Dropped dependency on FILENAME_MAX---too poorly defined in both
	POSIX and ANSI standards.  Adopted MAX_PATH_FILENAME which is
	set to 1024 (should be enough for most cases).  This should solve
	problem with HP installations.

94/10/29
	Problems with ellipsoidal for of azimuthal equidistant (PJ_aeqd.c).
	Some discrepancies remain on comparison with Snyder's examples
	but felt due to his use of TI calculator.  Procedure should be
	replaced with better geodesic routine.

94/10/29
	Corrected and added examples to geod.1 documentation.

94/10/30
	Added mkdir in nad/install otherwise nad2783 install may fail.

Rel. 4.3 94/2/16 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

94/3/13
	Equidistant Conic forced es to 0, thus previous ellipsoid usage flawed.

	Correction to sign of convergence angle and other details in
	pj_factors.c.

	Lambert Conf. conic corrected for +lat_0=90.

	Convergence sign in pj_factors.c corrected to conform to Bomford's
	definition.  Also procedure corrected for usage when projection
	returns some of its own factors.

94/3/17
	Added procedure pj_phi12 to support library.  It gets and checks
	standard parallels for some of the conics.

	Added SPECIAL entry to conics Lambert, Albers and Equidistant.

	Corrected nad/install.in test so as to only look for conus.lla.Z
	as test for installation of NADCON datum matricies.

94/3/19
	Problems with MAPGEN's mapdef choking on call to proj.  Fixed
	with PROJ.4.3-patch-01.

94/3/22
	Bumb mode of handling memory allocation for 2D arrays, so that
	execution of -L may not work on some systems.  Interim corrections
	distributed with PROJ.4.3-patch-02.

	Patched Make.2 to properly use $(LIBS).  Not in patch.

	Apple's Unix libc has problems---no strerror and no %n in ?format.

94/5/22
	Added several simple conics but not totally verified.

	Corrected proj.c so that resultant earth figure comments in -V
	are prefixed with # and do not blow *mapdef*.

	Releasing current code without documentation on new conics pending
	communications with Snyder on their veracity.  Release mainly to
	clean up patches.

Rel. 4.2.2 93/9/30 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/11/14
	1. Minor change to projects.h to correct prototype.
	2. Changes to pj_init.c regarding ignoring failure to open
	   proj_def.dat.
	3. Alternate method of initializing automatic array.

93/11/16
	DOS distribution.

93/11/28
	Added "Final" figure line to begining of -V option ouput.  Allows
	user to see results of +ellps and +R_V, etc. arguments.  "Feature,"
	not an error.  Mod to proj.c.

93/12/03
	Removed non-ANSI usage of errno from PJ_laea.
	Added test for previous definition of NULL in strtod.c.

93/12/12
	Made aatan2 (compensates for 0,0 args) global.

93/12/30
	Removed proj "error" message at end of -l option list.

94/1
	Major revision to projection structure to facilitate maintenance.
	Introduced PROJ_HEAD macro that is defined in several ways
	dependent upon use.  Allows generation of pj_list table from
	`grep'ed projection files.  Structure PJ now contains pointer
	to const string giving ascii description of projection.  Limited
	application projection list much easier to generate with this system.

	Many new pseudocylindrical projections added as well as a few new
	miscellaneous projections.  Total projection count now 110.

Rel. 4.2.1 93/9/30 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/10/3
	Geod incorrectly computed some forward values when geodesic on the
	merdian.

93/11/2
	Projection stere fails for polar cases because of 0 lat_ts.  Fixed
	by testing for lat_ts specification and setting to 90 degrees when
	lat_ts not specified.  UPS not affected.

93/11/5
	Inverse polar stereographic also failed on 0 x xor y.  Corrected.

93/11/10
	Changed "install" to include "plain" system type for systems that
	do not require special consideration.

Rel. 4.2 93/8/25 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/9/13
	Improved bch2bps.c code.  Old code not in error.
	Still problems with DEC native C compiler.

93/9/28
	Modified install script for DEC entry, forcing gcc for compilation.

93/9/29
	Problem with due South forward in geod.  Current version will not
	be fixed as it is to be replaced with Vincente algorithm.

93/9/30
	Two corrections in src/Makefile.

Rel. 4.1.3 93/4/15 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/5/22
	Extensively revised Chebychev approximation procedures and added
	conversion to power series.

93/6/8
	Changed type of pj_param, plus mods to some other internal procedures.

93/6/13
	Modified pj_factors.  Principle mod was that calling program must
	provide base for structure FACTORS.  Additional mods reflect
	optional analytic input from projection modules (see next entry).

	Modified base of PJ structure for projections to supply analytic
	values of partial derivatives, scale factors and/or convergence
	when formulary available.

	Added -V option for proj so as to provide more complete, verbose
	analysis of projection characteristics at selected geographic or
	cartesian point.

93/6/14
	Pj_errno given its own module and projects.h declares it external.
	To cover ANSI standards related to global variable.  SG linker should
	stop complaining.

93/7/15
	Several additions and a couple of minor corrections to elliptical
	tables.

93/8/4
	PJ_ocea.c error in applying k0.

93/8/19
	Minor general corrections.
	Added nadcon conversion procedures and nad2nad program.
	Projects.h modified to reflect nadcon prototypes and stuctures.
	pj_open_lib extracted from pj_init and made global for use in nad_init.

93/8/25
	Corrected pj_open_lib open for both binary and text modes.  Mostly
	for brain damaged DOS.  Also affected calls in pj_init.c and nad_init.c

	Installs and other scripts updated.

Rel. 4.1.2 93/4/4 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/4/8
	Corrected pj_inv so that errno and pj_errno are reset on entry.

93/4/14
	Added elliptical forms to Azimuthal Equidistant (aeqd).

93/4/15
	Corrected positive error return to negative in PJ_lcc.c .

	Added Indian units conversions to pj_units.

Rel. 4.1.1 93/3/26 Base-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

93/4/2
	gen_cheby.c - added <stdio.h> header.

93/4/3-4
	gen_cheby.c, projects.h - corrected gen_cheby argument declarations
		related to 'proj' argument and prototype.  Often signalled
		warnings, but still managed to execute OK.
	
	pj_init.c - local function get_init had insufficient storage
		defined for copy of file name and id.  Added id define.
		Strncat replaced with correct strncpy (amazingly did not
		cause problems except of one system).

	Proj now compiles on DOS Microsoft 5.0 C compiler.  MS suffers
		same brain-damage as DEC, so requires local strtod function.

	pj_strerrno prototype added to projects.h

	DOS option in strtod.c for MS C's lack of standard macros in neaders.

Rel. 4.1 93/3/8 Base-line --- @(#)CHANGE-LOG	4.14 95/09/23 GIE REL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
93/3/20
	pj_init -- added +k_0 as alternative to +k so as to match documentation.

93/3/21
	Laborde projection added.  Primarily for Madagascar grid.
	Considered BETA at moment until info obtained to give adequate
	documentation.

93/3/26
	Oblique Mercator modified to allow processing of Malasian Grid.
	+no_uoff and +rot_conv options added.

93/3/26
	Corrected text in Interim Report:
	p. 12 - +phi's changed to +lat's
	p. 12 - added updated Oblique Mercator documentation

Unresolved:

Reports of errno 25 persist.  Do not know what platform.  Reviewed
	code and can't see problem.
Unknown platform has problem with pj_errno global and linker storage
	allocation.  Seems similar to SG problem that was over come with 
	-common switch.
