.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBprojinfo\fP is a program that can query information on a geodetic object,
coordinate reference system (CRS) or coordinate operation, when the \fB\-s\fP and \fB\-t\fP
options are specified, and display it under different formats (PROJ string, WKT string).
.sp
It can also be used to query coordinate operations available between two CRS.
.sp
The program is named with some reference to the GDAL \fBgdalsrsinfo\fP that offers
partly similar services.
.sp
The following control parameters can appear in any order:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o formats
formats is a comma separated combination of:
\fBall\fP, \fBdefault\fP, \fBPROJ\fP, \fBWKT_ALL\fP, \fBWKT2_2015\fP, \fBWKT2_2018\fP, \fBWKT1_GDAL\fP, \fBWKT1_ESRI\fP\&.
.sp
Except \fBall\fP and \fBdefault\fP, other formats can be preceded by \fB\-\fP to disable them.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-k crs|operation
When used to query a single object with a AUTHORITY:CODE, determines the (k)ind of the object
in case there are CRS or coordinate operations with the same CODE.
The default is crs.
.UNINDENT

.B \-\-summary
When listing coordinate operations available between 2 CRS, return the
result in a summary format, mentionning only the name of the coordinate
operation, its accuracy and its area of use.

.B \-q
Turn on quiet mode. Quiet mode is only available for queries on single objects,
and only one output format is selected. In that mode, only the PROJ or WKT
string is displayed, without other introduction output. The output is then
potentially compatible of being piped in other utilities.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-area name_or_code
Specify an area of interest to restrict the results when researching
coordinate operations between 2 CRS. The area of interest can be specified either
as a name (e.g "Denmark \- onshore") or a AUTHORITY:CODE (EPSG:3237)
This option is exclusive of \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP\&.

.B \-\-bbox west_long,south_lat,east_long,north_lat
Specify an area of interest to restrict the results when researching
coordinate operations between 2 CRS. The area of interest is specified as a
bounding box with geographic coordinates, expressed in degrees in a
unspecified geographic CRS.
\fIwest_long\fP and \fIeast_long\fP should be in the [\-180,180] range, and
\fIsouth_lat\fP and \fInorth_lat\fP in the [\-90,90]. \fIwest_long\fP is generally lower than
\fIeast_long\fP, except in the case where the area of interest crosses the antimeridian.

.B \-\-spatial\-test contains|intersects
Specify how the area of use of coordinate operations found in the database
are compared to the area of use specified explicitly with \fI\%\-\-area\fP or \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP,
or derivedi implictly from the area of use of the source and target CRS.
By default, projinfo will only keep coordinate operations whose are of use
is strictly within the area of interest (\fBcontains\fP strategy).
If using the \fBintersects\fP strategy, the spatial test is relaxed, and any
coordinate operation whose area of use at least partly intersects the
area of interest is listed.

.B \-\-crs\-extent\-use none|both|intersection|smallest
Specify which area of interest to consider when no explicit one is specified
with \fI\%\-\-area\fP or \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP options.
By default (\fBsmallest\fP strategy), the area of
use of the source or target CRS will be looked, and the one that is the
smallest one in terms of area will be used as the area of interest.
If using \fBnone\fP, no area of interest is used.
If using \fBboth\fP, only coordinate operations that relate (contain or intersect
depending of the \fI\%\-\-spatial\-test\fP strategy) to the area of use of both CRS
are selected.
If using \fBintersection\fP, the area of interest is the intersection of the
bounding box of the area of use of the source and target CRS

.TP
.B \-\-grid\-check none|discard_missing|sort
Specify how the presence or absence of a horizontal or vertical shift grid
required for a coordinate operation affects the results returned when
researching coordinate operations between 2 CRS.
The default strategy is \fBsort\fP: in that case, all candidate
operations are returned, but the actual availability of the grids is used
to determine the sorting order. That is, if a coordinate operation involves
using a grid that is not available in the PROJ resource directories
(determined by the \fBPROJ_LIB\fP environment variable, it will be listed in
the bottom of the results.
The \fBnone\fP strategy completely disables the checks of presence of grids and
this returns the results as if all the grids where available.
The \fBdiscard_missing\fP strategy discards results that involve grids not
present in the PROJ resource directories.

.B \-show\-superseded
When enabled, coordinate operations that are superseded by others will be
listed. Note that supersession is not equivalent to deprecation: superseded
operations are still considered valid although they have a better equivalent,
whereas deprecated operations have been determined to be erroneous and are
not considered at all.

.B \-\-pivot\-crs none|{auth:code[,auth:code]*}
Determine if intermediate (pivot) CRS can be used when researching coordinate
operation between 2 CRS. A typical example is the WGS84 pivot. By default,
projinfo will consider any potential pivot. If using the \fBnone\fP strategy,
only direct transformations between the source and target CRS will be
used. It is also possible to restrict the pivot CRS to consider by specifying
one or several CRS by their AUTHORITY:CODE.

.B \-\-boundcrs\-to\-wgs84
When specified, this option researches a coordinate operation from the
base geographic CRS of the single CRS, source or target CRS to the WGS84
geographic CRS, and if found, wraps those CRS into a BoundCRS object.
This is mostly to be used for early\-binding approaches.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-\-main\-db\-path path
Specify the name and path of the database to be used by projinfo. The
default is proj.db in the PROJ resource directories.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-aux\-db\-path path
Specify the name and path of auxiliary databases, that are to be combined
with the main database. Those auxiliary databases must have a table
structure that is identical to the main database, but can be partly filled
and their entries can refer to entries of the main database.
The option may be repeated to specify several auxiliary databases.

.B \-\-c\-ify

.B \-\-single\-line
Output WKT strings on a single line, instead of multiple intended lines by
default.
