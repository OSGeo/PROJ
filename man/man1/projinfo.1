.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%projinfo\fP is a program that can query information on a geodetic object,
coordinate reference system (CRS) or coordinate operation, when the \fB\-s\fP and \fB\-t\fP
options are specified, and display it under different formats (PROJ string, WKT string
or PROJJSON string).
.sp
It can also be used to query coordinate operations available between two CRS.
.sp
The program is named with some reference to the GDAL \fI\%gdalsrsinfo\fP utility that offers
partly similar services.
.sp
The following control parameters can appear in any order:

Specify an area of interest to restrict the results when researching
coordinate operations between 2 CRS. The area of interest can be specified either
as a name (e.g "Denmark \- onshore") or a AUTHORITY:CODE (EPSG:3237)

bounding box with geographic coordinates, expressed in degrees in a
unspecified geographic CRS.
\fIwest_long\fP and \fIeast_long\fP should be in the [\-180,180] range, and
\fIsouth_lat\fP and \fInorth_lat\fP in the [\-90,90]. \fIwest_long\fP is generally lower than
\fIeast_long\fP, except in the case where the area of interest crosses the antimeridian.

are compared to the area of use specified explicitly with \fI\%\-\-area\fP or \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP,
or derived implicitly from the area of use of the source and target CRS.
By default, \fI\%projinfo\fP will only keep coordinate operations whose are of use
is strictly within the area of interest (\fBcontains\fP strategy).
If using the \fBintersects\fP strategy, the spatial test is relaxed, and any
coordinate operation whose area of use at least partly intersects the
area of interest is listed.

By default (\fBsmallest\fP strategy), the area of
use of the source or target CRS will be looked, and the one that is the
smallest one in terms of area will be used as the area of interest.
If using \fBnone\fP, no area of interest is used.
If using \fBboth\fP, only coordinate operations that relate (contain or intersect
depending of the \fI\%\-\-spatial\-test\fP strategy) to the area of use of both CRS
are selected.
If using \fBintersection\fP, the area of interest is the intersection of the
bounding box of the area of use of the source and target CRS

.B \-\-grid\-check none|discard_missing|sort|known_available
Specify how the presence or absence of a horizontal or vertical shift grid
required for a coordinate operation affects the results returned when
researching coordinate operations between 2 CRS.
The default strategy is \fBsort\fP (if \fI\%PROJ_NETWORK\fP is not defined).
In that case, all candidate
operations are returned, but the actual availability of the grids is used
to determine the sorting order. That is, if a coordinate operation involves
using a grid that is not available in the PROJ resource directories
(determined by the \fI\%PROJ_DATA\fP environment variable), it will be listed in
the bottom of the results.
The \fBnone\fP strategy completely disables the checks of presence of grids and
this returns the results as if all the grids where available.
The \fBdiscard_missing\fP strategy discards results that involve grids not
present in the PROJ resource directories.
The \fBknown_available\fP strategy discards results that involve grids not
present in the PROJ resource directories and that are not known of the CDN.
This is the default strategy is \fI\%PROJ_NETWORK\fP is set to \fBON\fP\&.

Determine if intermediate (pivot) CRS can be used when researching coordinate
operation between 2 CRS. A typical example is the WGS84 pivot. By default,
\fI\%projinfo\fP will consider any potential pivot if there is no direct transformation
( \fBif_no_direct_transformation\fP). If using the \fBnever\fP strategy,
only direct transformations between the source and target CRS will be
used. If using the \fBalways\fP strategy, intermediate CRS will be considered
even if there are direct transformations.
It is also possible to restrict the pivot CRS to consider by specifying
one or several CRS by their AUTHORITY:CODE.

.B \-\-identify
When used with an object definition, this queries the PROJ database to find
known objects, typically CRS, that are close or identical to the object.
Each candidate object is associated with an approximate likelihood percentage.
This is useful when used with a WKT string that lacks a EPSG identifier,
such as ESRI WKT1. This might also be used with PROJ strings.
For example, \fI+proj=utm +zone=31 +datum=WGS84 +type=crs\fP will be identified
with a likelihood of 70% to EPSG:32631

definition of the object as SQL statements will be appended.

.B \-\-list\-crs [list\-crs\-filter]

Outputs a list (authority name:code and CRS name) of the filtered CRSs from the database.
If no filter is provided all authority names and types of non deprecated CRSs are dumped.
list\-crs\-filter is a comma separated combination of: allow_deprecated,geodetic,geocentric,
geographic,geographic_2d,geographic_3d,vertical,projected,compound.

New in version 6.3.

.sp
"Promote" 2D CRS(s) to their 3D version, where the vertical axis is the
ellipsoidal height in metres, using the ellipsoid of the base geodetic CRS.
Depending on PROJ versions and the exact nature of the CRS involved,
especially before PROJ 9.1, a mix of 2D and 3D CRS could lead to 2D or 3D
transformations. Starting with PROJ 9.1, both CRS need to be 3D for vertical
transformation to possibly happen.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-output\-id=AUTH:NAME
New in version 8.1.

.sp
Identifier to assign to the object (for SQL output).
.sp
It is strongly recommended that new objects should not be added in common
registries, such as \fBEPSG\fP, \fBESRI\fP, \fBIAU\fP, etc.
Users should use a custom authority name instead. If a new object should be
added to the official EPSG registry, users are invited to follow the
procedure explained at \fI\%https://epsg.org/dataset\-change\-requests.html\fP\&.
.sp
Combined with \fI\%\-\-dump\-db\-structure\fP, users can create
auxiliary databases, instead of directly modifying the main \fBproj.db\fP database.
See the \fI\%example how to export to an auxiliary database\fP\&.
