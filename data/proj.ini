; Can be set to on so that by default the lack of a known resource files needed
; for the best transformation PROJ would normally use causes an error, or off
; to accept missing resource files without errors or warnings.
; This default value itself is overriden by the PROJ_ONLY_BEST_DEFAULT environment

; * poder_engsager is slower, but more accurate far from central meridian
; * default will auto-select between the two above depending on the coordinate
